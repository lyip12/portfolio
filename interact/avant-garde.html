    <p class="paragraph"><strong>Invest:</strong> The cost of investing in the idea is based on the “value” of the idea. Like how stocks work, if a user chooses to invest in an idea, the value increases and the user becomes a &quot;shareholder&quot; to the idea, and will be given the total amount the idea holds if it is brought-off by another user. If a user, after reading the full description of the idea, decides that it is not worth its value (or simply a &quot;scam&quot;) they can choose to withdraw, and receive 1/2 of their investment back while the value of the idea also decreases. <br></p><img src="../images/5e0f40a9aecc8345676b0343_Asset-10a-p-2600.png" srcset="../images/5e0f40a9aecc8345676b0343_Asset-10a-p-2600-p-800.png 800w, ../images/5e0f40a9aecc8345676b0343_Asset-10a-p-2600-p-1080.png 1080w, ../images/5e0f40a9aecc8345676b0343_Asset-10a-p-2600-p-1600.png 1600w, ../images/5e0f40a9aecc8345676b0343_Asset-10a-p-2600-p-2000.png 2000w, ../images/5e0f40a9aecc8345676b0343_Asset-10a-p-2600.png 2600w" sizes="(max-width: 3209px) 81vw, 2600px" alt="" class="image-85">

    <p class="paragraph">The idea then gets put in your personal collection. The Collection tab provides the user a full-view of their profile. They are able to find the invested ideas and concepts in their collection, allowing them to overlook the development of these ideas until they decide to &quot;buy&quot; the copyright of the idea, and make it a reality. <br></p>

    <p class="paragraph"><strong>Making it a reality:</strong> The last step in the process is about making the idea a reality. The user can buy-off their invested idea at any point if they are interested in the sole copyright of the idea, and turning it into reality via a product team / startup / etc. The platform will reward all invested users with the value of the investment, lock the idea, and recommend users in the field that may be of assist in making this happen. This way, the collaborative nature of the platform is taken advantage of, and increases the chance that the idea gets implemented / deployed. <br></p>
